The Bernot Lab is based in the Department of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology (EEB) at UConn. Learn more about [UConn EEB](https://eeb.uconn.edu).

### For grad students:
If you are interested in joining the lab, get in touch with Dr. Bernot at james.bernot@uconn.edu. In your email, it would be helpful to include: 
* Background information on yourself:
  * Your preparation for graduate school (e.g., undergraduate education, research experience, etc.)
  * Your research interests
  * Why you think the Bernot Lab would be a good place for your graduate research
  * If known, some ideas for potential research projects
* A copy of your CV

You can find [step-by-step application guide](https://eeb.uconn.edu/eeb-graduate-program-step-by-step-application-procedure/)  for the [EEB graduate program](https://eeb.uconn.edu/grads/) and a related [FAQ](https://eeb.uconn.edu/graduate-applicant-frequently-asked-questions/).

### For undergrads:
Undergraduates interested in research in the lab are highly encouraged to take one of Dr. Bernot's courses: Invertebrate Zoology (EEB 4275) and/or Introduction to Animal Parasitology (EEB 4274). It takes a while to learn techniques and complete a research project. To join the lab, undergraduates should commit to at least 9 hours/week in the lab (3+ independent study credits).
