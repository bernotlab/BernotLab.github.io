Netanya is a Masters student in the Bernot lab where she is studying the taxonomy of <i>Pseudotaeniacanthus</i>, a group of parasitic copepods of marine eels. She is working to describe new species and examine the phylogenetic relationships of the genus. Prior to joining the Bernot Lab, Netanya earned her BA in Biological Sciences at the University of Connecticut in 2023 and worked for 2 years doing research on the taxonomy and host associations of tapeworms of carcharhinid sharks and rays with Janine Caira. In the Bernot Lab, Netanya is applying her skills in microscopy, morphological methods, parasitology, and specimen curation to parasitic copepod systematics. She is also interested in scientific communication & outreach and has participated in community outreach events like Parasite Day and UConnâ€™s Bug Week. Outside of the lab, Netanya enjoys sci-fi books/podcasts, baking, and doing arts and crafts. Feel free to contact her on twitter @NetanyaAW
